# AudioStreamerYT
Console application to play audio from YouTube videos using a VLC instance

This project is intended to allow streaming audio only versions of youtube videos, it does not support playlists yet so longer videos would be preferred to avoid continually getting new video links.

The required packages can be installed using the following command in an elevated command prompt (or PowerShell) tested on Windows 10 only:

py -m pip install pafy, youtube-dl, python-vlc

Please note use requires installation of either x86 or x64 VLC player depending if you are using x86 or x64 Python (IT MUST MATCH)
